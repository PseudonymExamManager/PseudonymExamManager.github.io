# PseudonymExamManager

PseudonymExamManager is a web application designed to manage and pseudonymize exam data. The app operates entirely locally within your browser, ensuring that no data entered into the app leaves your computer. The only information stored in the browser is the entered university name and department (which can also be the chair).

## CampusNet Usage 

CampusNet and related applications are used at 70 universities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, including the University of Bremen, the University of Hamburg with StiNE, the sister university HafenCity University Hamburg, the University of Mainz, the University of Paderborn, the University of Leipzig, and the University of LÃ¼beck.

## Features

- **Local Data Processing**: All data processing, including sorting and generating PDFs, is performed locally in the browser. No data is sent to external servers.
- **Data Sorting and Sectioning**: The app sorts students by name and sections them based on the specified section size.
- **Cover Sheet Generation**: Generates cover sheets for each student with university name, exam date, exam name, department, section number, and a barcode (containing the matriculation number) twice on the sheet.
- **Grade Entry and Barcode Scanning**: After grading, the department secretariat scans the barcode on the cover sheet to find the correct student by matriculation number and enter the grade into CampusNet.
